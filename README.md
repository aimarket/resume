# Resume website
In 2020, a Reddit user named u/cybersir2077 posted a resume overhaul that was designed to look like it was pulled from the Cyberpunk 2077 game. The post included an impressive GIF animation that was created using Adobe After Effects, Premiere, and Illustrator. Inspired by the post, I decided to create a website that incorporated a similar design. After two years, I finally tackled the project during my summer break before starting at ASU. As a beginner in web development, I spent several days researching the best approach to bring my idea to life. Despite my initial doubts about using 3D libraries like three.js and webGL, I discovered that the entire project could be achieved with classic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The result was an impressive website that showcased my skills and passion for web development.
