# resume
Two years ago(2020) a popular post on a reddit forum called [r/cyberpunkgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/)

was posted by a user named [u/cybersir2077](https://www.reddit.com/user/cybersir2077/) titled "I spent ~50 hours overhauling my resume to look like it was pulled from Cyberpunk 2077!"

which had a jaw dropping GIF animation inspired by the cyberpunk207 game which was created using Adobe After effects, Premiere, and Illustrator.

That day, I took a mental note that I wanted to create a website page just like the GIF but set it off to the side while I worked on other projects.

After two years during my summer break, before heading off to ASU, the idea randomly creeped up again and this time, I could not let procrastination get the better of me.

As a newbie to webdevelopement, I had to take a couple days researching what the best approach for tackiling this problem would be.

I had no idea if would have to rely on 3d libraries like three.js, webGL, etc. but as it turns out, with enough work, the entire thing can be 

done using the classic HTML, CSS, and Javascript combo.
